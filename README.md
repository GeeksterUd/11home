in javascript file i get the element tip abd the button using get element by id method then i gave tip style display none beacuse we want the tip section to shown after the calculation then i added a event listener to button click event which after click will call a call back function inside which we will get the remaining the element and then we will store the tip value inside a element and to calculate the tip i use the formula bill amount * service value / number of people
and then i gave the display value as inline
